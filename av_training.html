    <h1>AV Training</h1>
    <p>
        If your tech team is in need of further training, contact me about setting up a training workshop. I’ll work with you to craft a
        workshop tailored to your needs. I offer training in audio, lighting, and video/livestreaming. <br /><br />

        My experience training AV techs in church settings has helped me to understand how best to approach training as well as which
        equipment features matter most for running a smooth church service.

                Brandon gave an excellent workshop to a group that included our regular sound techs and beginners. He was able
                to tailor his presentation so that everyone learned something new. His work on the board with our people was very helpful
                and encouraging to the potential sound techs. Highly recommend Brandon for his knowledge of the tech, understanding of worship
                leading and training ability.

    <h1>AV System Design and Installation</h1>
    <p>
        If you’re considering a system overhaul, I will work with you to design a solution tailored to your needs and your budget. During installation,
        I will guide your tech team through the installation process. This is an important step, because it provides your team with hands-on knowledge
        of the system, equipping them to troubleshoot and adapt the system to your changing needs. At the end of the process, I will provide thorough
        documentation so that your team is further equipped to handle future troubleshooting, repairs, and upgrades as needed.

                Brandon went above and beyond in designing a presentation system that not only meets our current needs
                but also leaves room for future growth. He took the time to understand our previous setup, listened carefully
                to our hopes and challenges, and crafted a solution tailored to us. What stood out most was his attention to
                detail—not just in the design, but in making sure we understood how everything fits and functions. Brandon also
                led our volunteer team through the installation process, building shared knowledge and ownership of our tech booth.
                We’re incredibly grateful for his expertise, patience, and investment in our team. If you're looking to improve your
                church tech and equip your volunteers, we highly recommend Brandon.
