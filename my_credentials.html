    <h1>Experience</h1>
        <p>
            I’m Brandon, a web developer and AV tech with a passion for helping churches navigate the online and AV spaces in a
            way that enhances their existing ministries. In my work, my first goal is always to understand what the church wants
            and needs. My background in ministry, tech, and theology has uniquely equipped me to work with your church to understand
            your needs and collaborate to find the best path forward.  My qualifications include a Bachelor or Theology in Church Ministry
            from Ambrose University, a Diploma in Computer Systems Technology from Saskatchewan Polytechnic, and a variety of ministry roles at
            several different churches, from traditional ministry roles working with kids and youth to tech-oriented roles. Combined, these experiences have
            equipped me to understand nd serve churches well in their tech needs.

        <h3>Testimony Video</h3>
        <h5>Westgate Alliance Church</h5>
        <p>
            I recorded and edited a video of people sharing their testimony from a mission's trip. This involved the initial planning with church staff to figure out
            the overall vision for the video they wanted. Once that was figured out, I recorded each person's testimony.

        <h3> Tech for Elementary School Christmas Concerts</h3>
        <h5>Circle Drive Alliance Church</h5>
        <p>
            Circle Drive Alliance had two neighbourhood elementary schools rent out their building for Christmas Concerts. I was hired to oversee both audio and lighting
            needs for these Christmas Concerts. This involved adapting to the school's needs during practice, as there was not a detailed plan for audio or lighting.

        <h3>Livestream Setup Overhaul</h3>
        <h5>Delisle Community Church</h5>
        <p>
            I was hired to redesign and install the new streaming setup for Delisle Community Church. For this, I assessed their needs, researched parts needed, led their
            tech team in installation, and provided documentation for the system. My approach with this project was centered around providing them a system that they understood
            the details. This led to me working alongside them in installation, so that the tech team was empowered and understood the system. This was important as it gave them
            the knowledge to troubleshoot and adapt the system to their changing needs.
