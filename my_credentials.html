    <h1>Experience</h1>
        <p>
            I have been working for churches for several years in various roles. I have done more traditional ministry oriented roles as well as
            tech oriented roles. This allows me to approach my work doing freelance work for churches through the mindset of the church. In my work,
            I use my experiences working at a church to understand the wants and needs of the church. On the AV side of things, this means I try to
            build up and empower your volunteer team to do the job, rather than just do it all myself.
        </p>
    <h1>Previous Projects</h1>
    <h3>Testimony Video</h3>
    <h5>Westgate Alliance Church</h5>
    <p>
        I recorded and edited a video of people sharing their testimony from a mission's trip. This involved the initial planning with church staff to figure out
        the overall vision for the video they wanted. Once that was figured out, I recorded each person's testimony.

    <h3> Tech for Elementary School Christmas Concerts</h3>
    <h5>Circle Drive Alliance Church</h5>

    <p>
        Circle Drive Alliance had two neighbourhood elementary schools rent out their building for Christmas Concerts. I was hired to oversee both audio and lighting
        needs for these Christmas Concerts. This involved adapting to the school's needs during practice, as there was not a detailed plan for audio or lighting.

    <h3>Livestream Setup Overhaul</h3>
    <h5>Delisle Community Church</h5>
    <p>
        I was hired to redesign and install the new streaming setup for Delisle Community Church. For this, I assessed their needs, researched parts needed, led their
        tech team in installation, and provided documentation for the system. My approach with this project was centered around providing them a system that they understood
        the details. This led to me working alongside them in installation, so that the tech team was empowered and understood the system. This was important as it gave them
        the knowledge to troubleshoot and adapt the system to their changing needs.
